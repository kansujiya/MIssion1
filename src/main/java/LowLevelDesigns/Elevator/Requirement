Requirement

Multiple Elevator: The system manages multiple elevators.
Request Handling: The system can handle requests to move to specific floors in a given direction (UP/DOWN).
Direction Management: The elevator maintains and updates its current direction (UP, DOWN, IDLE).
State Management: The elevator tracks its current floor, direction, and pending requests.
Efficient Movement: The elevator processes requests in an efficient order (e.g., all UP requests, then all DOWN requests).
Extensibility: Easy to add more elevators or advanced scheduling algorithms.

Core Entities
Elevator: Represents the elevator, manages its vendingMachineState, direction, and request queue.
ElevatorController: Handles incoming requests and delegates them to the elevator.
Request: Represents a request to move to a specific floor in a given direction.
Direction (enum): UP, DOWN, IDLE.
